### Overview

The following enum values represent the checkout session status that can be returned by the ArtPort API:

| ID | Status       | Description                                                                 |
|----|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0  | Rate Limited | ArtPort has hit the rate limit of the external shipment rate lookup system. |
| 1  | Failed   | ArtPort was unable to fetch carrier rates from the external system. Try again.                            |

<Note>
    ArtPort makes use of external services to determine shipment rates.

    A `0 (Rate Limited)` status does not indicate that your request to ArtPort was rate limited, but that ArtPort's request to the external service was rate limited.

    Unfortunately, ArtPort cannot provide more information about this rate limiting. Therefore, it's recommended to use a backoff strategy and retry the request after a short delay.
