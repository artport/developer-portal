### Overview

The following enum values represent the address verification status that can be returned by the ArtPort API:

| ID | Status       | Description                                                                 |
|----|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0  | Rate Limited | ArtPort has hit the rate limit of the external address verification system. |
| 1  | Unverified   | Something went wrong while checking the address.                            |
| 2  | Invalid      | A matching address could not be found.                                      |
| 3  | Recommended  | The address was not found, but a similar one exists.                        |
| 4  | Accepted     | The address has been verified.                                              |

<Note>
    ArtPort makes use of external services to verify addresses.

    A `0 (Rate Limited)` status does not indicate that your request to ArtPort was rate limited, but that ArtPort's request to the external service was rate limited.

    Unfortunately, ArtPort cannot provide more information about this rate limiting. Therefore, it's recommended to use a backoff strategy and retry the request after a short delay.
