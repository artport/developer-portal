title: 'Create Shipment'
---

### Overview

This endpoint can be used to create new shipments.

A maximum of 10 shipments can be created in a single request.

Endpoint: `/api/v1/shipments`

Method: `POST`

<Warning>
    It's advised you use the [Verify Address](/guide/api/addresses/verify) endpoint to ensure that the fulfillment address and destination address are valid before creating the shipment.

    Failure to verify the addresses may result in the shipment being lost, delayed, or extra charges being applied.
</Warning>

### Request

<Note>
    When creating a shipment, you can use either of the following two approaches to specify the fulfillment and destination addresses:

    - Using the `fulfillment_address_id` and `destination_address_id` fields to reference existing addresses that have already been stored in ArtPort.
    - Providing the address details directly in the `fulfillment_address` and `destination_address` fields.

    Please note, you can use a combination of both approaches for each shipment. For example, you can provide the `fulfillment_address_id` and `destination_address` fields, or vice versa, for a single shipment.

    For examples of how to use these fields, see the request examples on this page.
