### Overview

ArtPort authenticates your API requests using your organization's API token, which must be included every time.

<Warning>
    Requests without a token will return a `401 Unauthorized` response.
</Warning>

### Authorization

To authenticate, supply your API token in the request's header. You should configure the header so it uses `bearer` authentication e.g.

```php
request.headers.authorization = 'Bearer 2xH8eAQR...';
```

### Testing

ArtPort does not currently offer a dedicated sandbox environment where you can test your code in isolation.

While we are considering this, for the moment, we recommend that developers create a separate ArtPort account for testing purposes.
