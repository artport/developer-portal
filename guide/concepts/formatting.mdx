### Overview

The ArtPort API uses a variety of formats and conventions to ensure consistency across its endpoints. This guide provides an overview of the formats you can expect to encounter when working with the API.

### Timestamp Format

All timestamps returned by the ArtPort API use the given format:

```
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
```

For example, a timestamp representing "Monday, December 9, 2024 at 4:30pm" would be formatted as:

```
2024-12-09 16:30:00
```

<Note>
    All timestamps use the Coordinated Universal Time (**UTC**) timezone.

### Phone Numbers

ArtPort uses the E.164 standard for recording and displaying phone numbers. This standard requires that a number formatted like so:

#### Rules

1. It must begin with a `+` symbol prefix.
2. It must include the country code.
3. It must exclude any leading zeros.
4. It must include the area code.
5. It must include all remaining digits.
6. It must not include internal routing e.g. office extensions.
7. It must not include any other characters e.g. spaces or hyphens.

#### Examples

The following table demonstrates how a locally-formatted number in a particular country should be written to be E.164-compliant:

| Country     | Local        | E.164         |
|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| Australia   | 0491 570 159 | +61491570159  |
| Canada      | 206-953-6978 | +12069536978  |
| Ireland     | 0889 105 586 | +353889105586 |
| New Zealand | 09 567 4562  | +64495674562  |
