### Overview

ArtPort authenticates your API requests using your organization's API token, which must be included every time.

<Warning>
    Requests without a token will return a `401 Unauthorized` response.
</Warning>

<Warning>
    In order to use the API, your organization requires a subscription. If you do not have a subscription, then all requests will return a `402 Payment Needed` response.
</Warning>

### Authorization

To authenticate, supply your API token in the request's header. You should configure the header so it uses `bearer` authentication e.g.

```php
request.headers.authorization = 'Bearer 2xH8eAQR...';
```

### Headers and Format

The ArtPort API accepts request bodies in JSON format. When sending a request, you should include the following headers to indicate that you are sending and expecting JSON:

```text
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
```
